1
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,640
Hello.

2
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,000
How are you?

3
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,160
Are you going behind the bridge?

4
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,600
This bridge or the next one?

5
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,720
The next one, thank you.

6
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
Thank you.

7
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
What's that?

8
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
What you have mounted there.

9
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,040
This?

10
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,240
Is it an anti-theft device?

11
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,360
You could say that.

12
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,920
It looks like a fine piece of equipment.

13
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
Do you recognize it?

14
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,120
I'ts somewhat my department.

15
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,360
If I may say so,
it's a good idea to secure your vehicle.

16
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,800
I have a cousin, and the other day...
He had no idea what'd happened to him!

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,280
He goes out to work,

18
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,280
he sees that someone stole his wheels
and placed bricks instead!

19
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,400
What, which vehicle?

20
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,320
A Kia Pride, the poor guy!
Stealing the wheels of a caddy.

21
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,080
If I was this country's ruler,

22
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,200
I'd hang one or two 
to calm the others

23
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,160
Hang them? And then what?
You're being a bit harsh.

24
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,160
Perhaps this person only did
this out of necessity.

25
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
What if he simply must've, do you hear!

26
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,160
Which necessity?
What are you talking about?

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
Perhaps he was in desperate need.

28
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,680
And those who get screwed by his stealing,
Aren't they in need?

29
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,520
What about me!

30
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,880
Is it a reason to steal from others
when you're broke?

31
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
She's funny!

32
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,600
If it happened to you,
what would you do?

33
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,360
Would you love it?

34
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,360
No, of course not!
I wouldn't like it if it happened to me.

35
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,640
But killing people is never
a solution.

36
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,320
I think you should look for the
roots of this misbehaving.

37
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Alright, I said one or two...

38
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,200
We're not born criminals.

39
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,240
What're you trying to say?

40
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,800
If you lay down one or two,
the others will step in line.

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,840
I see, but you're wrong.

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,960
A crime occurs by an
interaction of circumstances.

43
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,520
Killing someone for stealing some wheels!

44
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Do you realize what you're saying?

45
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,640
Recently, two guys were hung.

46
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,400
For less than that.

47
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
A few people more or less doesn't matter.

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
You shild think carefully.

49
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,640
You don't have the slightest clue.

50
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,520
I know very well...

51
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000
There have been hangings
for a racketeering fraud recently...

52
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,360
And what did it change?

53
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,640
I don't understand you, lady.

54
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,240
It didn't solve anything.

55
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,960
Lady, it's the law and the sharia
who decide on that.

56
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,600
If it hasn't been resolved then,
it must be because

57
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
the law hasn't been applied well enough.

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,760
So, you're all pumped up about nothing.

59
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,200
According to you, to fully implement the law

60
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,280
we have to argue
the number of executions?

61
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,040
We already have the world record
of hangings after China!

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Have we learned our lesson?
I'm sure we have not.

63
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,160
I think you're quite a mouthful.

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
And you should do as I say
a little more often

65
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,560
The Parsian hospital, which direction is it?

66
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,280
Straight ahead.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,200
Or you'll fall behind.

68
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,040
What do you mean, straight ahead?
The Parsian hospital, that's on Sadaat Abad.

69
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
Between Kaj and Farhang.

70
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,280
Do I turn around?

71
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,880
Yes, you have to go to Sadaat Abad.

72
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,760
Okay, fine.

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,960
Have you gotten it with a Kinder Surprise,
your license?

74
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,760
Why?

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Is it your taxi or what?

76
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,600
Faut le faire pour pas savoir
où est l'hôpital Parsian.
You don't even know how to
get to the Parsian hospital.

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,360
I always go straight ahead.

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,200
Are you sure you haven't
tricked us by any chance?

79
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,160
We walk there.

80
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
What's the story?

81
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,360
I understand well, 
but since we're having this discussion

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I would like to ask you a question.

83
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm listening

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
What is your job?

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,240
I don't see the connection.

86
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,760
Oh, but there is a connection;

87
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,440
Quand on défend une idée,
c'est soit par conviction,
When you're defending an idea,
it's out of belief...

88
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,080
Or a particular interest.

89
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,000
I would like to know
what your profession is.

90
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,480
And you? Interrogations aside,
what do you do?

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
If I tell you, will you tell me?

92
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,160
Sure, we'll see.

93
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,840
I am a teacher.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
Come on, no kidding!

95
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Probably like Mary Poppins,

96
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Spending her time

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,960
keeping some brats busy

98
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,840
with entertainment.

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,600
I'd bet on that, anyway.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Fine! Now it's your turn.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm independent.

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm going to tell you
in which branch I'm working...

103
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
Wait, I have to get out right here.

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
What do I owe you?

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
Nothing, it's fine.

106
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Definitely...

107
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,520
You're definitely no taxi driver.

108
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,440
I've figured you out multiple times now.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Independent or not,
you must perform an activity.

110
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm going to get out, then I'll tell you.

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,520
Do you want the truth, little lady?

112
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,760
Yes.

113
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,000
My specialty is pickpocketing.

114
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,200
Pickpocketing?

115
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,240
Yes.

116
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,040
But I don't steal from professors like
you, or from taxis like these guys.

117
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,160
It's those who have fallen so far they
steal tires from underneath a Pride,

118
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,360
they cannot fall any lower,
they are less than nothing.

119
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,880
Also, an advice!
Stop crying for them.

120
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,840
Good luck.

121
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,480
Unbelievable.

122
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,640
Where does he get off, that one?

123
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,840
Hello, how are you?

124
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm arriving in ten minutes.

125
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,800
Yes, ten minutes.

126
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm going to get out over there.

127
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,560
Here is fine?

128
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,720
Yes, thank you.

129
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,640
There you are.

130
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Thank you.

131
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Thank you for not taking
another passenger.

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
- Can I get in?
- I'm sorry.

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,760
M. Panahi, I've recognized you!

134
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,400
Regardless of the hat.

135
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,600
Do you mind if I come sit in the front?

136
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,520
Sure.

137
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,240
Thank you very much.

138
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
You're doing a film, right?

139
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,000
That man and that woman...

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Can you take that one?
Thank you, to Shahran please.

141
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,760
They were actors, right?

142
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
Do you know how I figured it out?

143
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,760
That last thing he said was very much like

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,640
that sequence in the café from "Sang et Or"

145
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,720
You, a taxi driver?
Don't fool me. 

146
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,520
It's a job like any other.

147
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,320
It is, but it's not your job.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't you recognize me?

149
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,360
I seem to have forgotten.

150
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,680
It's me, Omid.

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,160
Omid who?

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
Omid, the film delivery guy!

153
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
I delivered those DVD's to you!

154
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
To your son, to be precise.

155
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,920
More than once even, you were there.

156
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,960
I asked you how you were doing.
You said: "I'm fine, lad."

157
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,400
You asked me to get you
Once Upon A Time In Anatolia.

158
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,640
No sooner said than done.

159
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,800
Why are you sweating so much?

160
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,840
It's very hot.

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,480
Guess which other film you wanted.

162
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,520
I don't recall.

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Midnight in Paris, from Woody Allen.

164
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,880
- Ah, that was you.
- Absolutely!

165
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,760
It's not out yet, this one.

166
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,280
And that isn't even everything...

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I can get even get you footage
from ungoing productions.

168
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,560
Hello. I'll call you back.

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Open the door!

170
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Hospital Chamran.

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,840
No, you can better go to Milad.

172
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,880
He doesn't have any money, the poor guy.

173
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,440
Where is it? How should we drive?

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Go quickly, please!

175
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
What happened?

176
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
There's been an accident.

177
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm dying...

178
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,960
A motorcycle accident.

179
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,160
It's not my fault.

180
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
I told you to keep your helmet on.

181
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,920
Paper, please...

182
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,120
Not a paper towel,
some paper so I can write my will.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Driver, take some paper and 
write down what I tell you.

184
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,120
What does he want?

185
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Write down what I tell you.

186
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,920
My wife doesn't understand.

187
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,640
According to the law,
she will inherit nothing.

188
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,520
A few turkeys at most.

189
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,600
She'll end up on the street.

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,520
Hurry up, please.

191
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
A mobile phone, do you have one?

192
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,360
No, not to make a phonecall. 

193
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,120
I want the camera.

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
On me.

195
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't any battery left.

196
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
The camera...

197
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,880
Turn it towards me.

198
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,520
Film me.

199
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,760
In the name of the great Allah...

200
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,040
I am Mohammad Rabei,

201
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,320
born in Ramhormoz.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,640
ID card number 508,

203
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,960
Issued in the same city.

204
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,640
Stop crying, they can't hear me like this.

205
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,440
Son of Amin,

206
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,240
Healthy in body and mind, 
I leave to my wife

207
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,840
My house at Ghale Hassan Khan,

208
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,800
Bahar, rue Izadi, number 34,

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,160
and all my possesions.

210
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,600
May God forgive me.

211
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,680
I ask of all my brothers,
to leave my wife alone.

212
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,720
Do not conspire against her,

213
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,560
and respect my final wish

214
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,040
To leave her alone.

215
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,680
This will...

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,640
must not fall into their hands.

217
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
Let her guard it.

218
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
There is no other God than Allah.

219
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,720
Get him out.

220
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,160
Help me, hold there.

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,320
It's not worth it, take leave!

222
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,880
Wait.

223
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,080
Give me the will please, mister.

224
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,400
I will give it to you later.

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
Take my card, call me.

226
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,200
The ambulance is here, let's go.

227
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,760
There.

228
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,400
He's dead?

229
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,560
He'll be fine, it was mostly fear.

230
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,320
He was looking really bad.

231
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,880
His eyes were closed.

232
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,400
Yes, it's me.

233
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,120
Is it you?

234
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,040
No, madam.

235
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,120
Rest assured, this is my real number.

236
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
Of course.

237
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,040
I'll call you as soon as possible.

238
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,920
Goodbye.

239
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,680
Was that her?

240
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,800
The husband died?

241
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,120
She wanted some certainty.

242
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,080
She was verifying if this
was really my phone number.

243
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:11,040
You believe I really don't realize
that was all staged, do you?

244
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,960
An empty battery.

245
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,480
Can I use your phone?

246
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,400
Thank you.

247
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,560
I'll unlock it.

248
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,240
Hello, I'll be there in ten minutes.

249
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,280
I assure you. Something'd come up.

250
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
I know, but this time it's true.

251
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,520
Alright...

252
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,360
I'll be there in ten minutes.

253
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,040
Why, thank you.

254
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,040
It's in the sixth street.

255
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
Fourth...

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,120
The next one on the left.

257
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,120
It's at the end of the impasse.

258
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,360
You can park next to the white car.

259
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,000
Can you open the door?

260
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,640
Yes, hello.

261
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,600
Is this the taxi driver?

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
Yes, I'm listening.

263
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,560
I had an accident with my husband.
You brought us to the hospital.

264
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,200
Yes, I recognized your voice.

265
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,240
Have you changed your number?

266
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
It's my husband's...

267
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,680
I wanted to tell you
that I'm in town,

268
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
To come recover it.

269
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,800
Recover what?

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,240
The film, of course.

271
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,640
But your husband is better, right?

272
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,320
Yes, he's better.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,560
But we do not know what
the future holds.

274
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,400
I prefer to have it, just in case.

275
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,480
As soon as I've made a copy,
I'll call you. I Promise.

276
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
Don't call this number.

277
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,440
Call my cellphone.

278
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't forget, I beg of you.

279
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,960
I won't forget.
Don't worry, I'll call you.

280
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
God bless you!

281
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,600
Hello, how are you doing?

282
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,360
Don't stay  here, go inside the mansion.

283
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,200
Thank you, here will do.

284
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
Take a look.

285
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,880
Va_y, il est des nôtres.

286
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,480
In the pile, there is season 5
of The Walking Dead.

287
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,000
No zombie movies.

288
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,560
- It's what you asked of me.
- It wasn't for me.

289
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,400
In any case, it's here.

290
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,920
There's 4 Hollywood blockbusters...

291
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,120
One with Mel Gibson...

292
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,040
No commercial movies.

293
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,480
Copyrighted movies?

294
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,040
Yes, what do you have?

295
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,240
I have a Kim Du...

296
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
Who's that?

297
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,760
The Korean!

298
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,160
I also have an old Kurosawa.

299
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,160
This is a rare one,
there aren't many copies.

300
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,800
Understood?

301
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,040
That one too, it's great.

302
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,960
Yes?

303
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
This must be a mistake.
Who are you looking for?

304
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,680
Hold on.

305
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,440
Omid, it's for you.

306
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,840
Who is it?

307
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,560
I don't know.

308
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
One moment.

309
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,640
Continue looking.

310
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
M. Panahi...

311
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm astounded, I don't know...

312
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,080
It's hard to believe that
you are associated to Omid.

313
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,000
- Who said we're associates?
- He did!

314
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,920
I saw most classics.

315
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,240
Are there any new films 
I should take a look at?

316
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
Let's see!

317
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,920
Any film's worth seeing.

318
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,440
The rest is a matter of taste.

319
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,000
I welcome you to my home.

320
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,040
Thank you, that's kind.

321
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
This one.

322
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,200
And, that one.

323
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,360
Can I ask you something?

324
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,440
Yes, go ahead.

325
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,800
I study films,
and I have to make a short movie.

326
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
- Which department?
- Realisation.

327
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,720
- At college?
- Yes.

328
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm looking for a good subject.

329
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,880
I've seen many films,
and read many novels.

330
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,000
But I can't seem to find a good subject.

331
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,360
Listen to me...

332
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,440
Those films have already been made,
those books have already been written.

333
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,360
You have to look elsewhere.

334
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,640
You won't find it by staying at home.

335
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,520
Where do I need to go?
What do I need to do?

336
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,080
That's the most difficult part.

337
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,160
No one can help you with that.

338
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,320
It's up to you to find it.

339
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,880
Thank you.

340
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,800
Thank you very much.

341
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,480
And?

342
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
I've taken these.

343
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,800
All those?

344
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,080
45 tomans.

345
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,840
I'll have The Big Bang Theory next week.

346
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,360
Fine!

347
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,480
Same time next week.

348
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,080
Too bad you didn't come in, next time.

349
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,320
Thank you.

350
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,600
Goodbye, good luck.

351
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,120
Since when are we associates?

352
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,840
ANNOUNCER: "Door not closed."

353
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
This is not mine.

354
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,880
Take us with you, please.

355
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,000
We're late, our taxi didn't arrive.

356
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,760
Where are you going?

357
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,560
Cheshmeh Ali.

358
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,120
Cheshmeh Ali...

359
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,840
- We're late.
- It's not on our way!

360
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,160
We haven't asked you.

361
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,480
Please, sir.

362
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,520
We have to be there at twelve.

363
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,240
Please take us. 

364
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,960
I will take you there.
This gentleman is getting out further on.

365
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,840
One moment.

366
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,000
Go to the other side.
Let me grab my bag.

367
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,320
I hope we'll be on time.

368
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,880
Move over a little.

369
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
Be careful not to spill any water.

370
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,640
Be glad that we ran into this.
You're always groaning.

371
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,120
And if we don't arrive in time?

372
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,520
Of course we will.
Why wouldn't we make it?

373
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,760
I assure you...

374
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,600
That I didn't want to tell him that.

375
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,560
But usually, he buys around 3 films.

376
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
This time he took everything.

377
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,440
And that's because of you.

378
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,880
If you go with me to see my clients,

379
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,800
We'll bring the house down!

380
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,240
As a partner, then?

381
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,640
It's a cultural activity, what I do.

382
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,600
These films do not come out in Iran.

383
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,200
How can these college student
see them otherwise?

384
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,160
Your son, for example.

385
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,040
And even you!

386
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,720
Without me, adieu Woody Allen!

387
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,960
It's just as at home.

388
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,120
I tell him: "Why do you lock yourself in the bathroom?"

389
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,160
Who is risking to come watch
your dream body?

390
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,920
You're much too relaxed.

391
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,120
When you're this calm,
it necessarily irritates the others.

392
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,760
- You're speaking about yourself?
- Of course.

393
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
You're always on edge.
I'm normal at least.

394
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm fine just as I am.

395
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,680
My friend, I will ask you
to get out over there.

396
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,080
There?

397
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,240
Yes, you can find another taxi.

398
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,720
How much do I owe you?

399
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,280
Save it for your cultural activities,
it's okay.

400
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
- It's closed.
- I'll open it.

401
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,240
He won't let go.

402
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,600
M. Panahi...

403
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,680
I assure you, I wanted 
to help you.

404
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,840
I did not mean to disrespect you.

405
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
I meant no harm.

406
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
Thank you, goodbye.

407
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,600
The time on the display is correct?

408
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,320
Let's see...

409
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,680
It's delayed by a few minutes.

410
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,160
When will we be at Cheshmeh Ali ?

411
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,440
It depends on the traffic.

412
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,960
Will we be there before twelve?

413
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
I hope so.

414
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,760
Even if there is traffic?

415
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,000
I don't know.

416
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,840
Accelerate and we'll be there in time,
God willing.

417
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,000
God willing? And then what?

418
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,720
We have to be there before twelve!

419
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,320
Excusez-moi...

420
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,840
People often go there in the afternoon,
why the hurry?

421
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,240
We're not going for fun, 
it's very serious.

422
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,120
We must throw these fish into
the fountain at twelve precisely.

423
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,080
You don't seem to understand.

424
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,000
Our lives depend on it.

425
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,240
In the water at twelve, exact!

426
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,560
A matter of life and death.

427
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,520
The fish, they will die.

428
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,440
Sir, hurry!

429
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,680
Faster, they'll die.

430
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
ll va m'achever.

431
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,080
Hurry, they're going to die!

432
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,880
Lift your foot.

433
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,040
They're dying.

434
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,520
Don't crush them.

435
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,640
Faster.

436
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,600
Go ahead, pour!

437
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,600
Quickly, put the fish in.

438
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,960
There's enough water!

439
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,800
Everything's fine.

440
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,640
A minute.

441
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,800
Is it dead?

442
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,760
A moment.

443
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,920
Pick up the pieces of glass.

444
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,520
He's just standing there watching us.

445
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,000
It's nothing.

446
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,440
The fish are fine.

447
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,720
Okay.

448
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,800
I beg your pardon, I'm sorry.

449
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,600
ANNOUNCER: "The number you called cannot
be reached, please try again later."

450
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,160
- Aren't they hurt?
- No.

451
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,360
I am really sorry.

452
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,520
I listened to you and I got distracted.

453
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,480
Why do ordinary fish
matter this much to you?

454
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,840
They aren't ordinary at all!

455
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,080
We've taken care of them for a year.

456
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,560
And after a year, you put
them back into the water?

457
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,120
Haven't you understood?

458
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,200
It's very simple.

459
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
We took them from the well of Chesmeh Ali.

460
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,800
We have been born five years apart,

461
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,120
but both at noon.

462
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,240
So, we have to put them into
the water at noon,

463
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,560
and take two new ones. Otherwise,
it's the end of us.

464
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,160
Dead, gone! Do you understand?

465
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,160
Do not talk about misfortune.

466
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,240
It's twelve or death.

467
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,440
Pardon me, I have to make a call.

468
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,480
I'll drop you off after the bridge.

469
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,440
I'll find you another cab.
He'll be faster.

470
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,520
We absolutely must...

471
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,960
Because I'll have to pick up
my niece from school.

472
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,920
Please, bring us!

473
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,000
We have to be there at twelve!

474
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,200
I would've liked to,
but she cannot go home alone.

475
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,760
We will never make it in time!

476
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,400
- What is he doing?
- No idea.

477
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,520
To hell with this incompetence.

478
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,520
He drives like a donky
and moreover, he is lost.

479
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,400
What is he doing?

480
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't know at all.

481
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,200
Have mercy, we won't make it otherwise.

482
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,840
He knows the way, it will go faster.

483
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,880
We'll never be there at twelve.

484
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,720
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
What a moron!

486
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,760
Thank you, goodbye.

487
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:40,320
You've come to pick me up
in this heap of garbage?

488
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,400
I've told everyone that
my uncle is a CEO!

489
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,760
They're going to say I'm a liar!
Think of my reputation!

490
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,040
You talk to me about discipline,

491
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,760
And you left me hanging around for an hour.

492
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,160
And there you are, bluntly staring at me.

493
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm sorry, young lady.

494
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,480
By the way, hello.

495
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,440
Hello, don't change the subject.

496
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,240
What would you have done
if somebody abducted me?

497
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,360
T'inquiète, ça risque pas d'arriver.
Don't worry, I don't believe that would happen.

498
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,600
Nobody would have the nerve to do that.

499
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,520
Enter.

500
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,960
I have an appointment with an old friend.

501
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,680
And your pretty niece,
is she worth nothing?

502
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,080
I'll go.
I'll leave you to your appointment.

503
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
I'll find my way, like
the girl in The Mirror.

504
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,600
Am I going or not going?

505
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,480
As you wish.

506
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,840
You're defintely not funny.
It was such a joy for me to see you.

507
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:39,000
You arrive too late and now you go on, too bad!

508
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,600
I've already said I'm sorry.
Why are you making such a scene?

509
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm joking.

510
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,320
If I would've wanted to leave,
I wouldn't have waited.

511
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,000
Why did you turn off your cellphone?

512
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,640
Should I tell you the truth?

513
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,720
If you're capable of that for once.

514
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,640
When have I ever lied to you.

515
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,320
Go on, I'm listening.

516
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,800
I was sure you were going to call
me with lots of excuses

517
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,240
not to pick me up.

518
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,480
And what if I would've been worried?

519
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,800
I do like mom.

520
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,360
When you forget her,
she pretends to be sick...

521
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:21,880
And she doesn't reply to your calls.
You disembark all the time!

522
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,520
Hello, how are you?

523
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,040
It's me, Panahi.

524
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,440
I'm very sorry for the dalay.

525
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:58,080
No, I'm coming.

526
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,880
Where are you?

527
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,840
Stay there,
I'll be there in a few minutes.

528
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,840
Stay there and wait for me.

529
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,040
I'll be there any moment now.

530
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Did he think you were
going to let him down?

531
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,000
Never mind.

532
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,240
So, what did you want to talk about?

533
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,560
Not while we're driving.

534
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,160
Why not? We can discuss.

535
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,960
You're impossible, my poor uncle.

536
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,920
When you're out with a lady
as distinguished and cultivates as I,

537
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,320
One should first intive her to drink an ice coffee,

538
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,000
and only then should one
engage in conversation.

539
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,040
Alright, tell me what you want,

540
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,680
My cultivated and cultured ice coffee lady?

541
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,920
My film teacher has asked us...

542
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,040
to shoot a short movie
for the upcoming month.

543
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm going to film you so I don't lose
any of your advice.

544
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,120
In other words, you're looking for a subject.

545
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,400
Bravo, you're smarting than you let on.

546
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,040
By the way...

547
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,120
The other day, mom was home
and we heard screaming.

548
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,280
It was the neighbours.

549
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,600
Something was going on at their house.

550
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
It was their daughter's suitor!

551
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,440
They'd put their daughter's suitor at the door?

552
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,800
The story, it was the girl that

553
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,640
fell in love with an Afghan man.

554
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,160
The father did not know.

555
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,680
When he came to ask her hand,
the fauther caught them.

556
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,680
He took him outside and
forbade his daughter to leave.

557
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,600
The guy stayed in the street all his days
just to get a glimpse of her.

558
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,560
The brothers of the girl went out
to intimidate him,

559
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,680
but he did not give up!

560
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,280
And then?

561
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,880
Finally, you're not going to be
to keen about this...

562
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,280
I've filmed everything.

563
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,160
You filmed everything.

564
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,720
Absolutely, from A to Z.

565
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
So, then you already have your film.
Why are you looking for a topic?

566
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,440
Oh, come on!

567
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,440
You're a directer, you have to know
that this isn't broadcastable.

568
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,000
That it's not what?

569
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,040
Broad-cast-able.

570
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,000
All filmmakers know this. Don't you?

571
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,000
It's not possible.

572
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,200
Do you have the intention to distribute it?

573
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,480
Naturally.

574
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,120
At the school's National Film Festival.

575
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,240
Parents are invited to the screening,

576
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,200
and a jury will select the best film.

577
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,320
And so, then we received an idea for
another movie, even more uneligible.

578
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,000
Tell me.

579
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,640
Yes, Arash.

580
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,480
Je viens de tourner sous le pont.
I'm just turning on the bridge.

581
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,840
Where are you?

582
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,720
I'm dropping off Divist Dastgah.

583
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,240
The other side...

584
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,400
On the streetcorner...

585
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,880
The white vehicle, that's it?

586
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,440
That's it, I've seen you.
I'm coming.

587
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,720
Haven't you seen him for a long time?

588
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,920
Six or seven years.

589
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,080
Can I tell you something?

590
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,720
It doesn't look like a friend of yours.

591
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,680
Son père était l'ami de papi.
His father was my Grandpa's friend.

592
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,160
They were our neighbours.

593
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,760
Enter.

594
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,920
So, lady Hana.

595
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,080
How are you?

596
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,920
Fine, thank you.

597
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,480
It's a hassle to see your uncle.

598
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,160
You see, he's forgotten his old coursins.

599
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,480
Not only does he never call,

600
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,440
he also doesn't return my calls ever.

601
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,080
Do you want a juicebox?

602
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,800
An orange juice, an ice-cream?

603
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,080
No, thank you.

604
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,080
She has her uncle's manners.

605
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,200
- An ice coffe maybe?
- I love that!

606
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,280
Let's go.

607
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,680
Sorry I didn't invite you in,
I wasn't alone.

608
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,720
I don't want anyone to know.

609
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,680
Have a look, I'll be back in a moment.

610
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,800
What is it?

611
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,480
Look, you'll understand.

612
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,560
He's weird, your friend.

613
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,280
He told me to leave my camera here.

614
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,440
Are you sure he's not going to kidnap me?

615
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,040
Do you want CD's?

616
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:44,840
I have al the new ones.
You can even test them!

617
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,920
I have a CD with
Andy, Shamaizadeh, Shahrokh...

618
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,840
I have another one with
Farhad Fardin, Mohamad Alizadeh...

619
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,400
It just came out.

620
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,280
They're both Iranien nationals
and foreign music.

621
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,600
How much?

622
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,680
Just that.

623
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,280
2 tomans a piece.

624
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,760
There's two.

625
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:59,080
Have you seen?

626
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:00,280
Have you been hurt?

627
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,520
Not that bad.

628
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,520
When was it?

629
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,920
It's been about a month.

630
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,560
I recently employed video surveillance.

631
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,200
Can I look again?

632
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,520
I'll show you the images
of the other camera.

633
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,600
There, that's the woman.

634
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,520
And that, the man.

635
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,480
He hit me on the head.

636
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:29,400
That's his wife.

637
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,240
Was it a couple?

638
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,240
When he struck me to the wall and hit me,

639
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,320
the mask on his face slipped.

640
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,600
I've seen his eyes
and I had recognized him.

641
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,600
His face was familiar.

642
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,120
What did you do?

643
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,520
What could I do?

644
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,600
Have you reported him?

645
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,520
Why not?

646
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,760
It was just after...

647
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,040
All we heard about all the time was the 
executions of those two racketeers.

648
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,240
I did not have the heart.
I tried, but I could not.

649
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,800
That was something else entirely.

650
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,880
The racket had circulated pictures,
they wanted to mark the occasion.

651
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,080
It has nothing to do with your story.

652
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,840
It's not that.

653
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,600
I recognized them.

654
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,760
Both of them.

655
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,400
They're familiar to me.

656
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,840
Meanwhile,

657
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,400
I learned

658
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,960
they were desperate,

659
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:47,320
but with what they have stolen from me,

660
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,320
they were able to recover.

661
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:52,720
Knowing this, I could not

662
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,760
go denounce them.

663
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,240
But when I see them, I'm furious.

664
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,840
I have a lump in my throat.

665
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,440
I thought it would
do me well to tell you.

666
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:07,960
And even if you, you cannot shoot it,

667
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:10,200
perhaps another filmmaker

668
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,440
can make a movie about it someday.

669
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
Hold these.

670
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,280
Something else?

671
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,200
It's him.

672
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,680
- Who?
- My attacker.

673
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,040
You should have told me before.

674
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,320
I wanted to see his face.

675
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,360
What for?

676
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,240
Just to see what a thief looks like.

677
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,200
Like you, like me,

678
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,560
like all the people around us.

679
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,080
How are you now?

680
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,440
Better.

681
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,960
I'm better.

682
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:20,600
Haven't you moved?

683
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,640
I'm always there.

684
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,040
Faithful to the post.

685
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,960
I passed by once.

686
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,640
I didn't recognize our street.

687
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,680
Everything had changed,
the houses were different.

688
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,960
The people have also changed.

689
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:46,000
Only occasionally, 
you meet a familiar face.

690
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:48,160
Everything changed.

691
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:58,920
Glad to see you again.

692
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,320
Thank you.

693
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,000
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

694
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,680
- Need anything?
- No, thank you.

695
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,520
Tell Hana to return. 

696
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,880
It was a pleasure.

697
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,040
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

698
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:22,200
Goodbye.

699
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,640
They were really friendly.
Especially those who served us.

700
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,680
Tell me,

701
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,360
What did he look like?

702
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,120
What do you mean?

703
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,600
He looked normal, like anyone else. 

704
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,640
So, you want to make a publisheable film?

705
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,480
Yes, I was going to read this to you
when you got the call.

706
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,440
There we go.

707
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:54,160
The teacher told us
that to make a broadcastable film,

708
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Are you filming or are you reading?

709
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,640
It's one or the other.

710
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
She told us that to
make a broadcastable film,

711
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:09,160
A film needs to have
the following rules;

712
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,800
Respect for the veil
and the Muslim decency,

713
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,160
no contact between man and woman,

714
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,280
no conspiracies,

715
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,000
no violence,

716
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,080
no tie for protagonists,

717
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:28,800
no Persian names for protagonists,

718
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,680
preferance for the first
names of Muslim prophets,

719
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,240
usage of the sacred
names of the prophets,

720
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,800
Why aren't you listening?

721
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,840
I'm listening, I was just thinking...

722
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,960
What about?

723
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,480
I was wondering...

724
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,440
what was going to happen

725
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,400
to my old neighbour.

726
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,640
Is it a positive or a negative character?

727
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,600
He has a Persian name and a tie...

728
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,840
Oh you, that's in real life.

729
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,520
These rules, they're for films.

730
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,400
And what if he should become a
protagonist in a movie?

731
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,920
Then everything needs to be altered.

732
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,640
Everything?

733
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,600
He should firstly be given a Muslim name,

734
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,760
his tie should be removed,

735
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,280
And also, he should have no beard.
It makes him a bit...

736
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:31,200
May I continue?
737
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:32,640
Go ahead.

738
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,360
Don't pose policital
or economical questions.

739
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,440
That's enough.

740
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,080
But no, it's not yet finished.

741
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,920
She told us to use our common sense,

742
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,440
to feel the smaller problems,

743
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,360
to masque our own.

744
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,640
"For you to see," she said.

745
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,480
My dear uncle,

746
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,240
listen...

747
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,960
Stay here,

748
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:27,040
I'll be back.

749
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,360
Are you going to the toilet?

750
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,840
No questions!

751
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:30,920
You're not coming out,
752
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,880
and you don't open
the door for anyone.

753
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,280
- "And you don't talk to strangers."
- What?

754
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,320
Nothing, I'm joking. 
You don't have any humour.

755
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,120
Hi!

756
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,400
Hey, you!

757
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,760
Come over here.

758
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,320
Yes, you!

759
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:35,160
No camera's.

760
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,080
Come here.

761
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,920
Put your camera away.

762
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,840
I saw you take that!

763
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:44,680
What?

764
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,880
The money.

765
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,880
The money in the trash cans?

766
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,680
Non, l'argent qui esttombé
de la poche du marié.
No, the money that fell
out of the groom's pocket.

767
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,680
Out of the groom's pocket?
I haven't seen anything.

768
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,360
I have seen it, and I filmed it too.

769
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,800
So what ? I do not care.
It fell.

770
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
I found it, now it's mine.

771
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:04,280
It is the groom who dropped it.

772
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,760
Listen to me, I have a month time

773
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,960
to make a broadcastable film.

774
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,640
If you take the money,
I won't be able to air it.

775
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,120
Go give it back to him.

776
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,640
In exchange, I'll give you 5 tomans.

777
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,600
Exchange 50 tomans for 5?

778
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,600
You must be stupid.

779
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,560
Don't worry about them.

780
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,080
They're very wealthy, look at how much
they paid for clothing the couple.

781
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:32,080
I don't care about their money,

782
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,160
I want to make my film!

783
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,800
Go give the money back,
I won't forget about it.

784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,040
Like this, you will be the
hero of my film.

785
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:43,920
Then it will be a movie
on the meaning of self-denial.

786
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:45,920
I beg of you.

787
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,280
What are you talking about?

788
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,920
I don't care about being your hero.
I want to give that money to my father.

789
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,760
Come on, please. Be a
little more sympathetic.

790
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,160
Do it for your mother.

791
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,800
I don't have a mother.

792
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,840
Even if you don't have
one anymore, 

793
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,320
You must have loved her right?

794
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:06,280
Do it to make her happy.

795
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,320
Return the money, please.

796
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:15,880
Fine, you can go bring it...

797
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,320
No, it's up to you to do it.

798
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:21,200
You do it, and I'll film you!

799
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:23,640
Come on, please!

800
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,480
I beg of you.

801
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,480
Are you dumb or something?

802
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,040
Faster, they're leaving.

803
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,000
Give it to them...

804
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,360
Go...

805
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,440
Come on, give it back to them!

806
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,640
What's wrong, what is it?

807
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,120
Nothing.

808
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,360
You don't want to tell me?

809
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,240
Out of the question.
I don't want to talk about it.

810
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,240
As you wish, young lady.

811
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,040
Have you heard?

812
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,440
What?

813
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,520
The noise, outside...

814
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:11,400
I was holding my head down.
I haven't noticed anything.

815
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,160
I've seen nothing.

816
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,160
Look, there she is!

817
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,480
Who is?

818
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:23,600
The flower lady!

819
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,760
Where?

820
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,200
Can't you see her?

821
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,160
The lady who always comes to see
you with a large bouquet of roses!

822
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:41,800
Good afternoon, get in.

823
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Our very own Jafar Panahi, in person!

824
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:47,480
Where are you heading?

825
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,240
I'll call you back.

826
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,000
I'll take you.

827
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:53,240
Get in the front.

828
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,440
You already have a
young passenger here.

829
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,360
Thank you, my love.

830
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:07,040
How are you?

831
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,760
Well, very well!

832
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:13,840
For you, my treasure.

833
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,080
Thank you.

834
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,440
Are you doing back there?

835
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,000
What's going on?
What was that back there?

836
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:24,840
Where are you heading?

837
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,880
Are you the driver?
That's just the job for you...

838
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,640
Are you looking for someone?

839
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:36,800
I've heard a voice before seeing you.

840
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,600
The voice of a person who
I heard when I was imprisoned.

841
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,400
It often happens to my clients.

842
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,200
They focus on voices.

843
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,720
That's the effect of being blindfolded.

844
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,760
The voice chasing you...

845
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,600
So, where may I take you?

846
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,080
To paradise!

847
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,240
To paradise?

848
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,880
I think I know a street...

849
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,400
Oh, that paradise?

850
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,360
Yes, that one.

851
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,120
Unfortunately, I believe that
access is restricted to men.

852
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,840
Seriously, where I you going?

853
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:18,400
I'm going to Vanak.

854
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,280
If it's on the way.
Otherwise, I won't bother you.

855
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,960
Let me guess...

856
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,800
This is for someone who
has just been released.

857
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,080
Or, who has been arrested?

858
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,760
Unfortunately...

859
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,480
Ghoncheh Ghavami is imprisoned.

860
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,200
The sports girl?

861
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,600
Like, in your movie,

862
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,320
"Offside".

863
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,840
She wanted to watch
a game of volleyball.

864
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,800
They were with a group of women,

865
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:54,600
that got arrested.

866
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,440
Everyone else got released, 
except for her... Since 108 days.

867
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:01,000
Has she managed to go?

868
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:04,160
No, they were stopped
outside of the stadium.

869
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,000
She went on a hunger
strike ten days ago.

870
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:12,880
Her mother went to see her yesterday,

871
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:17,080
to try to convince her to stop.

872
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,760
I sent her a message,

873
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,320
also begging to stop, while
also saying that I understood.

874
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:25,640
It's the same tactic we used,

875
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,920
in that situation.

876
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,760
She acted like us.

877
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,920
So, her mother brings her food
in hope to convince her.

878
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,200
So, they took her to a
closed room with camera's.

879
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,560
to make her talk.

880
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,720
A television interview?

881
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,200
Exactly.

882
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,800
They asked her to confirm that her 
daughter never went on a hunger strike.

883
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,960
She became furious,

884
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,080
And went out screaming, 
thus she can no longer visit her.

885
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,320
She distanced herself from food afterwards.

886
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,920
They asked the same of Ghoncheh in her
cell, but in a written format:

887
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:08,200
"I have never been on a hunger strike"

888
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,560
She tore the paper apart,
and lost her guest priviliges.

889
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,960
That's the story.

890
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,040
I'm going to meet the family,

891
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:21,200
To see what we can do
for this girl,

892
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,640
that, after yesterday,
also stopped drinking.

893
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:28,280
We will try everything.

894
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,840
What to do?

895
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:31,840
I see.

896
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,200
How is your husband?

897
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:38,120
He's fine, he's working.

898
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,400
Hasn't he forbidden you to exercise?

899
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,600
No.

900
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,880
I heard you were suspended,

901
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:47,600
for three years!

902
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,840
It's official, the Disciplinary
Board,

903
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,840
have voted on my suspension.

904
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:58,320
I haven't had any prior notification.

905
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,480
So, for now... Nothing!

906
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:03,280
The decision isn't valid.

907
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:06,520
A disciplinary board, why?

908
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,200
I don't know.

909
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,120
Is it not possible to defend your own rights?

910
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,280
As if the film-makers union
would want your ban revoked.

911
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,960
What would you do?

912
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,800
It's wet over here.
Who does this wallet belong to?

913
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,160
Show me.

914
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,040
There.

915
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,480
Look if you can find an
address inside.

916
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,520
Come on, you can't do that.

917
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,520
That's not the way to go...

918
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,520
Sorry, I forgot.

919
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,760
In any case, whoever dropped it
wasn't a young person.

920
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:47,560
She's not my age, nor my mother's...

921
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,640
It's certain, she's an old one.

922
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,360
More like grandma's age?

923
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,720
Indeed.

924
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:55,680
Then it must be from...

925
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,160
the ladies that wanted
to go to Cheshmeh Ali.

926
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,400
Those were my latest passengers. 

927
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,440
Cheshmeh Ali?

928
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,560
You have to find them,
that's your destination.

929
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,080
I'll drop you off first.

930
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:10,240
I'm going to get out here. 

931
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,680
You have to go down Nawab street,

932
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,680
while I have to go the other way.

933
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,600
These are opposite directions.

934
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,600
Do what you have to do.

935
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,480
That is for the love of film.

936
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,080
I put it there for the people of the cinema,
on whom you can always count.

937
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:29,480
Like you.

938
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,880
I put it there,

939
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:35,400
to show you
that I see what you're doing.

940
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,200
You know, Jafar.

941
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,480
They make sure,

942
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,040
that we know we're being monitored.

943
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,360
Their tactics are clear.

944
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,720
They create a political record,

945
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,040
You become a target of Mossad,
the CIA, MI5.

946
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:55,960
Then, they'll add a sex scandal.

947
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,640
They make your life a prison.

948
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:02,920
You go out, but the outside world,

949
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:05,440
Is nothing but an even larger prison.

950
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:09,240
They make your besr friends,
your worst enemies.

951
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,880
You will have to flee the country,

952
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,080
Or leave you praying for a safe return.

953
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,880
So there is nothing else to do:
Nothing to do!

954
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,200
Alright.

955
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,040
Do not put what I've just
said in your film.

956
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,840
If not,
you will be accused of conspiring.

957
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,320
Then, you will have even more problems.

958
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:37,760
Quickly, the light is green.

959
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,160
Thank you, it was a pleasure!
960
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:42,640
Hurry!

961
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,840
Enter.

962
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,640
She's ingenious.

963
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,360
The flower lady?

964
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:07,520
By the way, what is it, conspiring?

965
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,840
You had it in your list earlier.

966
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:15,480
Yes, the teacher told us.

967
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,440
But I haven't understood.

968
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,280
She explained it badly.

969
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:22,400
She said that you should only show reality.

970
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,440
But when reality is complicated or ugly,

971
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,640
one cannot show this.

972
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,840
I do not understand
what to show or not,

973
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:35,200
what is supposed to be real or not.

974
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:37,080
I don't want to fail.

975
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:42,160
For example, everything
that the flower lady just said,

976
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:46,680
cannot be shown.

977
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,880
However, all she says is real.

978
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,320
There are realities
they do not want to show.

979
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,760
They create them, but
they do not want to show them?

980
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,520
I don't understand.

981
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,000
It's pretty, that flower.

982
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,400
I'll go see if they're here.

983
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:24,200
They're here.

984
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:28,320
- Where's the wallet?
- In my backpack.

985
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:37,000
- He's coming back!
- I don't have the memory card!

986
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,800
We'll get that later, let's go!

987
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,840
Taxi Teheran

988
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:57,320
A film of Jafar Panahi

989
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,120
