1
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,496
Hello.

2
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,954
Good day to you.

3
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,996
Are you heading by the overpass?

4
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,538
The second one?

5
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,788
Yes, the one after this.

6
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,204
Thanks.

7
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,038
What's that?

8
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,538
That item thats on the dash

9
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:16,871
This?

10
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:19,163
Is it some sort of n antitheft device?

11
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:21,371
Yeah, sort of.

12
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,079
It looks pretty interesting

13
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,538
Really? Are you at all familiar with
this sort of device?

14
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,538
It's sort of my line of work.

15
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,538
Trust me on this.

16
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,996
You have to be careful.

17
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:41,621
A cousin of mine, poor guy,
he left the house,

18
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,204
got in his car to go to work

19
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:49,413
only to notice
all 4 of his car's tires had been replaced by a stack of bricks the night before.

20
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,579
What kind of car?

21
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:51,996
Just a cheap model!

22
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,663
Honestly, stealing tires from such
a cheap old car!

23
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,538
If I were in charge of this country's laws,

24
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,829
I'd hang a couple of them
just to send a message on theft crimes

25
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:08,038
Hang them? You seem quick to condemn to death without
 considering whose lives might in fact be at stake!

26
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:11,913
Maybe some poor guys did it out of desperate need!

27
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,288
I cant believe you'd say that!

28
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:18,621
Need? What are you talking about?

29
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,288
Maybe they were in desperate need of some kind!

30
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:24,204
Our driver here could argue that he also has needs as it were

31
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,121
And why not me too,
 while we are at it

32
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:29,621
No excuse to steal from others and
make them less well off

33
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,704
What are you saying?

34
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,538
Would you like if it happened to you?

35
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,371
Would that be fun?

36
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:40,538
No, I wouldn't be happy
if it happened to me.

37
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:43,954
I'm just saying you're quick
to hand out death sentences.

38
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:47,788
We need to get to the actual root
of the problem in each instance.

39
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,579
If they took a couple of them...

40
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:52,871
No one's born a thief I say!

41
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,996
How the hell could you be so sure of that?

42
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:59,746
If they hang just a couple of men, to make an example
of them, others would quickly get the message.

43
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,913
I understand what you are saying, but I dont accept your
idea is a valid one

44
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,204
Circumstances arise, men find themselves involved in
a "crime" perhaps even without having intended to so become.

45
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:09,871
But to hang men over some car tires?

46
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,204
You arent saying what it is that
would really be sensible to do

47
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,204
Remember, that not that long ago,

48
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,079
men were hanged in our state for even being
found to have done much less than that.

49
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:21,413
Who cares about them? It might lessen crime

50
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,954
Spare me.

51
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,621
You're in another world!

52
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:31,204
Sure I heard they got hanged for serious crimes as
assault or whatever else of that nature.

53
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:34,704
And yet, you must realize that it has not made such crimes
disappear altogether

54
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,079
You're not making sense with that point.

55
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,788
No actual problems were in fact solved that way...

56
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:43,663
The laws of the land are prescribed according to the
application of religious rules known as sharia law here.

57
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:48,496
If such extreme punishments havent yet eliminated
crimes

58
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:50,954
it may be because they havent been fully been
enforced well enough

59
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,871
So relax dear lady!

60
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,454
So you think applying religiously based so-called
Sharia law is the panacea to our problems

61
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:00,663
by increasing the number of executions?

62
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:05,621
For gods sake, Iran has the greatest number of executions
annually on the planet - second only to China!

63
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:08,871
You call that a solution? I think not!

64
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,996
You havent accepted a damn thing Ive said!

65
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,621
You dont realize what youre suggesting
instead of sharia punishments wont work

66
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,579
The Parssian Hospital?

67
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,371
Straight ahead.

68
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,371
Straight and you get there.

69
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:23,913
No, that's the wrong way for Parssian!

70
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,038
Saadat Abad,
between Kaj Square and Farhang.

71
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,829
So I make a U-turn?

72
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:32,538
Yeah, go to Saadat Abad.

73
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,496
Mister...

74
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,413
you're not usually a Taxi driver, are you?

75
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,704
What do you mean?

76
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,079
You call yourself a cabbie!

77
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:44,288
I just dont think it sounds likely

78
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,913
Not if you dont even know how to get
to the Parssian Hospital - as you should!

79
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,746
Straight ahead...

80
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,704
I guess you're really down on your luck

81
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,746
to be trying to be in this line of work as cabbie

82
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:56,913
What's up?

83
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:01,163
I follow you,
but now that we're chatting,

84
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,038
may I please ask you a question?

85
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,371
Shoot, lady!

86
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,079
Are you employed?

87
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:10,413
What does this have to do with anything?

88
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,996
There could be a connection

89
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:15,829
When you defend an idea,
either you believe in it

90
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,538
or you believe it to otherwise be nevertheless,
in your interest to do so as you do.

91
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:20,579
It's not an unreasonable question to ask I think
So, what work do you do?

92
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:24,204
I could ask you the same rather than
go on with this seeming inquisition?

93
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,871
You'll answer if I do?

94
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,079
You first, maybe I'll respond equally

95
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,829
I'm a teacher.

96
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,663
It figures, aye Cabbie!

97
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,788
You work in fiction, lady.

98
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:42,413
Reading too many books
and spending days with kids

99
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,413
has made your opinions sound a bit too Pollyanna like

100
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,329
Even if you hadn't told me,
I'd have guessed.

101
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,621
Now tell me what you do.

102
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:54,204
My work is freelance.

103
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,329
I'll tell you my speciality later.

104
00:07:56,746 --> 00:08:00,121
I'll get off there
after the lights, please.

105
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,163
How much?

106
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:03,663
No need to pay.

107
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:06,996
Youre kiddin

108
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:10,079
Well you're definitely not a pro as a cabbie I'd say

109
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:13,121
And you did get carried away a couple of times. But here's your pay

110
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:17,121
What exactly do you freelance at?

111
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,954
I'll get out and tell you...

112
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:23,621
You really want the truth?

113
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:24,913
I do.

114
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,246
I actually might just be a mugger! hows that!

115
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:28,496
A mugger?

116
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:29,579
Yes.

117
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:34,579
But I don't mug teachers
or cab drivers like him.

118
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:38,871
People who rob the tires off the cars of the poor

119
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,829
can't stoop any lower.

120
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:43,246
Losers of the worst kind.

121
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:46,913
Take my advice. Don't pity them!

122
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:48,954
God bless.

123
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,663
Unbelievable.

124
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,913
Where did he come from?

125
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,413
How are you?

126
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,371
Be there in 10 minutes. Okay...

127
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,579
10 minutes.

128
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,163
I'll get off a bit further on.

129
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:10,538
Here?

130
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:11,746
Yes, thanks.

131
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,829
Here's the fare.

132
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,538
Thank you.

133
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,496
I'll hire your taxi just for me.

134
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,621
- Shariaty?
- Sorry, no.

135
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:52,413
Mr. Panahi, I recognize you.

136
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:57,246
Even with the beret,
I recognize you.

137
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,663
Can you stop
so I can sit in front?

138
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,704
Thank you.

139
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,204
Thanks very much.

140
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,538
You're making a movie, right?

141
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,413
The man and the woman...

142
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:40,996
Take a left, thanks.
To Shahran.

143
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,496
They were actors, right?

144
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,871
Know how I figured it out?

145
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:50,746
His last line was
like in the coffee shop scene

146
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,663
in "Crimson Gold", wasn't it?

147
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,996
You, a cabbie? No way, Mr. Panahi.

148
00:10:58,204 --> 00:10:59,871
Ajob like another.

149
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:03,829
Sure, but you're not in your element!

150
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,663
You really don't recognize me?

151
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,246
I must have forgotten.

152
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:15,663
I'm Omid.

153
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,204
Omid who?

154
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:20,496
Omid the video renter!

155
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,496
I used to bring you movies!

156
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,038
For your son, I mean. Not you.

157
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,454
You were there once.

158
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,496
I said “Hello, how are you?”

159
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,704
You said “Fine, dear boy!”

160
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:38,288
You wanted
"Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"

161
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:40,621
by Nuri Ceylan. I gave it to you.

162
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,913
Why are you sweating so much?

163
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,079
It's so hot.

164
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,829
You wanted another movie too,
remember?

165
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,038
I don't!

166
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:57,246
“Midnight in Paris”, Woody Allen!

167
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,621
- That was you.
- Of course!

168
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:16,163
It hasn't opened yet.

169
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,788
You haven't seen a thing!

170
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:23,913
I can bring you dailies
of movies in the making.

171
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:37,829
Call you back.

172
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:47,079
Put him in!

173
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:52,079
Chamran Hospital.

174
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,788
Why on earth Chamran?

175
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,913
Go to Milad. He's poor!

176
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,663
Where is it? How do I get there?

177
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:07,454
Go on, step on it.

178
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,746
What happened?

179
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,413
An accident.

180
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,621
I'm dying-n

181
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,704
A bike accident.

182
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,121
Not my fault.

183
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,329
I said he should be the one
with the helmet.

184
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,121
Some paper...

185
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,663
No, I want to write my will.

186
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:42,913
Please find some paper
to write what I must say.

187
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,079
What does he want exactly?

188
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,288
Write down what I tell you.

189
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,079
My wife doesn't get it.

190
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,913
According to law, she can't inherit.

191
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,954
At most she'll get a few turkeys.

192
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,538
She'll be homeless!

193
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:05,288
Drive faster! Go to the hospital.

194
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:07,954
A cell phone! You have one?

195
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,413
It's not to make a call.

196
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,246
I need a camera.

197
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,538
Turn it on.

198
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,496
Mine has no battery.

199
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,163
The camera...

200
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,746
Point it at me.

201
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,538
Film me!

202
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,871
God be my witness!

203
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,288
My name is Mohamadi Rabei,

204
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:44,663
born in Ramhormoz.

205
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:49,163
ID number 508,

206
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:51,579
issued in Ramhormoz.

207
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:55,413
Don't cry. They won't hear my voice.

208
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,288
Son of Amin,

209
00:14:57,538 --> 00:15:01,246
sound of mind and body,

210
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,996
I leave my wife my house
in the Hassan Kahn area

211
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:09,121
Spring Street, lzadi Alley number 34,

212
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,621
and all my belongings.

213
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,246
Forgive me, God!

214
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:21,496
My brothers should leave her in peace.

215
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,663
They mustn't file a claim.

216
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:28,663
They must respect
this last will and testament.

217
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,246
I leave everything to my wife.

218
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:32,954
This testament

219
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:37,079
must be kept from my brothers.
It's hers.

220
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,454
She should keep it.

221
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:44,038
There is no God but Allah...

222
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,788
Help him out.

223
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,413
Give me a hand.

224
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:50,496
It's not necessary. Go with him!

225
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:10,038
She's coming back.

226
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:15,454
Please give me
the film of the will, sir.

227
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:17,871
I can't now. Call me later.

228
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:22,746
My card. I'll give it to you later.

229
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:27,038
Move your car. Ambulance coming!

230
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,163
Here you go.

231
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:44,954
Did he die?

232
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,246
He's fine. He was just scared.

233
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:51,121
He was in very bad shape.

234
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,829
He closed his eyes at the end.

235
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,829
This is he.

236
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:08,621
Is it you, madam?

237
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,621
No, ma'am.

238
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,829
Rest assured. This is my number.

239
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,038
Sure...

240
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:21,038
I'll call you as soon as I can.

241
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,038
Good bye.

242
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,954
Was it her?

243
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,204
The husband died?

244
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,621
Just to make sure.

245
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,704
She was checking the number.

246
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:43,954
You planned it all
and thought I wouldn't guess...

247
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,163
Damn, no more battery.

248
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:54,829
May I use yours to make a call?

249
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:56,829
Thanks.

250
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:59,079
Let me do the code.

251
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:10,204
Hi, how is it going? In 10 minutes.

252
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:14,413
Relax, I'll be there.
I had something to do.

253
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:18,454
What do you mean,
I keep saying in 10 minutes?

254
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:19,871
Okay...

255
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:22,829
I'll be there in 10.

256
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,663
Thank you very much.

257
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,538
The 6th street, please.

258
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,038
This is the 4th...

259
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:01,121
Get ready to take a left.

260
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:18,829
All the way to the end.

261
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:24,038
Pull up next to the white car.

262
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,329
Can you unlock?

263
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,829
Hello? Who is it?

264
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,871
<i>Is this the taxi driver?</i>

265
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,788
How can I help you?

266
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:04,496
<i>I'm the woman
with the injured husband.</i>

267
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,163
<i>You took us to hospital.</i>

268
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,913
Sure, I recognize you.

269
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:12,079
You've changed your number,
haven't you?

270
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:15,288
<i>It's my husband's phone.</i>

271
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:19,829
<i>I wanted to tell you,
now that I'm in town,</i>

272
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:23,038
<i>can I come and get it?</i>

273
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,163
Get what?

274
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:27,704
<i>The video, obviously.</i>

275
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,204
I thought he was better.

276
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,954
<i>He is...</i>

277
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:36,371
<i>but you never know about tomorrow.</i>

278
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:39,329
<i>I'd like to keep it handy, just in case.</i>

279
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:45,663
I'll let you know once I make a copy.

280
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,579
<i>Don't call this number.</i>

281
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:50,829
<i>Call my cell.</i>

282
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,996
<i>Please don't forget.</i>

283
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:57,621
I won't. Don't worry, I'll definitely call.

284
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:00,163
<i>God bless you. Goodbye.</i>

285
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,204
Mr. Panahi! Hi!

286
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,079
Please come inside.

287
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,996
I'm fine, thanks.

288
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:35,996
Have a look.

289
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,204
Go in. Relax, he's one of us.

290
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,079
I brought you "Walking Dead", season 5.

291
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:47,788
No zombie movies.

292
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,163
You asked for it.

293
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:50,121
For my family.

294
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,246
You asked for it. Here it is.

295
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,954
And I brought you
4 Hollywood blockbusters.

296
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,204
Mel Gibson...

297
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,204
No commercial stuff.

298
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:01,704
Art house?

299
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,329
Yeah, like what?

300
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,663
I have a Kim du...

301
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:07,996
Kim du who?

302
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,288
The Korean guy!

303
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:13,871
This is a rare old Kurosawa.

304
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:15,079
Just for you.

305
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:16,996
The last one I have.

306
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:18,704
Get it?

307
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:21,038
This is arty too.

308
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,246
Yes?

309
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:32,871
Wrong number. Who is it?

310
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,288
Hold on...

311
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,163
Mr. Omid, it's for you.

312
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,621
Who is it?

313
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,413
He didn't say.

314
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:51,329
Just a minute.

315
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,913
Keep on looking.

316
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:01,829
Mr.Panahi...

317
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:06,538
I'm confused about what to take.

318
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:11,079
It's hard to believe
you're partners with Omid.

319
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,121
- Who said we're partners?
- He did!

320
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,413
I've seen most of the famous classics.

321
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,871
Which new ones are worth watching?

322
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,621
Let's see.

323
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,788
I think all movies are worth watching.

324
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,413
Depends on your taste.

325
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:41,204
I feel bad. You should have come inside.

326
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,329
I'm fine.

327
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:44,746
This is good.

328
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:49,746
This too.

329
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,079
Can I ask a favor?

330
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:55,204
Sure.

331
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:58,704
I'm studying film. I have to make a short.

332
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:00,996
- What major?
- Directing.

333
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:02,788
- School of Arts?
- Yes.

334
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,704
I'm looking for a good subject.

335
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,163
I've seen movies, read lots of books

336
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,413
but can't find a good subject.

337
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:14,913
Listen,

338
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:19,163
those films are already made,
those books already written.

339
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,246
You have to look elsewhere.

340
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:25,621
It won't come just by itself.

341
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:28,621
What do I do? Where do I start?

342
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,246
This is the hardest part.

343
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:33,454
No one can tell you.

344
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:35,704
You must find it yourself.

345
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,371
Thanks.

346
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:45,579
Thank you, sir.

347
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,329
What did you pick?

348
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:48,538
These.

349
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,871
All these?

350
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,329
45 tomans.

351
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:07,246
I'll bring “Big Bang Theory” next week.

352
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,163
Okay...

353
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:14,413
Same time, next week.

354
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,329
Mr.Panahi,
I still wish you'd come in.

355
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:25,121
You're very kind.

356
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,038
Good bye.

357
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,954
So we're partners now?

358
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:01,663
<i>The door is open.</i>

359
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:10,038
Please give us a lift.

360
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:13,288
We're in a rush.
We've been waiting for a cab.

361
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,121
Where to?

362
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,996
Ali's Spring.

363
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:18,621
Ali's Spring...

364
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:23,538
- We're really late.
- Different directions!

365
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,913
Keep quiet!

366
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,288
Please, sir.

367
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:28,413
We have until noon.

368
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,204
Please take us.

369
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:34,079
I'll drive you closer.
He'll get out soon.

370
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:34,996
Wait a sec.

371
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:39,329
Use that door. I'll move my bag.

372
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:49,038
I hope we make it on time.

373
00:27:59,663 --> 00:28:01,079
Scoot over.

374
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,621
Don't get the car wet.

375
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:12,288
You kept complaining
but we found a cab.

376
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:13,829
What if we're late?

377
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:17,371
Of course we won't be late.
It'll be fine.

378
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:20,746
Believe me...

379
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,704
I didn't mean to say that.

380
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,788
Usually he just takes a few videos.

381
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:29,788
This time he took so many.

382
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:31,871
It was because of you.

383
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,454
If you came along to my other clients...

384
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:38,496
you'd make a fortune.

385
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,038
As partners, right?

386
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,621
This a cultural activity too.

387
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:48,704
They don't show these movies in Iran.

388
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,413
How else can students see foreign movies?

389
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,496
Your own son!

390
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,454
Even you!

391
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,246
Without me, no more Woody Allen!

392
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,704
At home

393
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,204
it's just us.

394
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:07,996
Why shut the bathroom door?

395
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,163
No one to spy on your beautiful body!

396
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:16,121
It's not good to be too carefree.

397
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:20,496
Overly carefree people
get on others' nerves...

398
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,246
- You mean yourself.
- Yes!

399
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:26,121
You're always on edge.

400
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,579
Dear fellow, you can get off here.

401
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,329
Here?

402
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:45,621
You can catch another taxi here.

403
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,329
What do I owe you?

404
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:56,079
Keep it for your cultural activity!

405
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:03,204
- It's locked.
- I got it.

406
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:16,871
He doesn't give up.

407
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,329
Believe me,

408
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:22,538
I just meant it as a favor.

409
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:25,829
On my wife's life,
I meant no disrespect!

410
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,954
The best I could do.

411
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:30,704
You're too kind. Thanks...

412
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:39,121
Excuse me, is your clock right?

413
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,913
Let me check...

414
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,579
A few minutes behind.

415
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,163
How far is the spring?

416
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:55,621
Ali's Spring? Depends on the traffic.

417
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:59,288
Can we make it before noon?

418
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:00,788
I hope so.

419
00:31:00,954 --> 00:31:04,288
We'll make it even with traffic?

420
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,621
I can't say.

421
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:10,621
Go faster
and we'll make it, God willing!

422
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,913
God willing?
We must be on time!

423
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,746
No later than noon!

424
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,454
Excuse me...

425
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:35,621
Most people spend the afternoon.
Why so early?

426
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:39,163
This isn't for fun. it's very serious!

427
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,163
These fish must be in the spring
exactly at 12.

428
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,204
Don't you get it?

429
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,204
Our lives depend on it.

430
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,538
In the water by 12!

431
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,954
Our lives depend on it!

432
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,496
Oh my God, the fish are dying!

433
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,579
Sir, hurry!

434
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,038
Please hurry! They're dying!

435
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,288
Too much emotion!

436
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:22,746
Hurry, they're dying!

437
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:24,621
Lift your foot.

438
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:26,871
They're dying!

439
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,454
Don't squash them.

440
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:31,663
Faster!

441
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,788
Pour it in.

442
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:39,954
Quick, put the fish inside!

443
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,371
Enough water!

444
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,288
They'll be fine.

445
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,204
Just a minute.

446
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,454
Is it dead?

447
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,621
Just a minute.

448
00:32:58,204 --> 00:33:00,079
Remove the glass.

449
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,204
He stands there, staring.

450
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,788
It's nothing...

451
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,329
The fish are fine.

452
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:21,746
They're fine.

453
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,329
I'm really very sorry.

454
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:54,954
<i>The number you are calling
is not available.</i>

455
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:58,371
They're not hurt?

456
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,038
AQai", my apologies.

457
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:07,371
I was listening to you
and got distracted.

458
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:11,496
Why are they so special?
They seem like normal fish.

459
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,954
They're anything but normal.

460
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,329
We've kept them for a whole year!

461
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:21,996
And now you throw them back
into Ali's Spring?

462
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,329
Why don't you get it?

463
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:26,829
You're not paying attention!

464
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,871
We took them from the spring

465
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:32,663
because we were born 5 years apart.

466
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:35,079
But both at noon!

467
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:39,371
We have to throw them at noon
into Ali's Spring

468
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,329
and get two new ones.

469
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,871
Or else we're dead!

470
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,579
Understand? Dead!

471
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:48,413
God forbid!

472
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,829
At noon or we die.

473
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:54,163
I have to make a call.

474
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:08,788
Sorry, you must get out
after the overpass.

475
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:10,663
I'll hail you another cab.

476
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,871
It'll be fast.

477
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,038
I have to be somewhere.

478
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:17,621
I must pick up my niece at school.

479
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:19,663
We beg of you.

480
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:21,829
We have to be there by noon!

481
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:27,246
If I don't get there,
she can't walk home alone.

482
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:33,038
We'll never make it before noon.

483
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:34,871
What's he doing?

484
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:36,829
No idea.

485
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:43,204
What the hell? Such a lousy driver.

486
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,329
No sense of direction. Can't even drive.

487
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,288
What's he doing?

488
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:49,829
I have no idea.

489
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,329
We won't get there on time.

490
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,121
He knows the way and drives faster.

491
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:01,288
We'll never make it before noon.

492
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,288
I apologize again.

493
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,746
What a moron.

494
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:17,829
Thank you very much.

495
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,454
Why did you come in this car for me?

496
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:02,663
I told everyone
my director uncle was coming!

497
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,746
Now no one will believe me!

498
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,204
Think at least about my reputation.

499
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,579
You always talk about discipline.

500
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,413
I've been hanging around for an hour!

501
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:15,954
And all you do is keep quiet and stare.

502
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,913
Excuse me, young lady.

503
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,454
And hello to you too!

504
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,538
Hello. Don't change the subject.

505
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:26,454
What do you tell my parents
if I get kidnapped?

506
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,663
I wouldn't worry about that.

507
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:32,038
No one could stand all your blabbering.

508
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:32,996
Hop in.

509
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:36,579
I have to meet an old neighbor of mine.

510
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:40,454
You keep promises
to everyone but your niece!

511
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,996
Maybe I should leave you
to your meetings?

512
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:48,371
I'd find my way
like the girl in your “Mirror” film.

513
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,829
Shall I go or shall I stay?

514
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,788
Your choice.

515
00:38:53,954 --> 00:38:55,038
Meanie!

516
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:57,288
I was so excited to see you today!

517
00:38:57,454 --> 00:39:00,579
You're late and
now you want to leave me!

518
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:04,329
I apologized.
You're the one who won't quit!

519
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,621
I was teasing you.

520
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:11,413
If I wanted to leave,
I wouldn't have waited.

521
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,121
Why was your phone off?

522
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,829
You want the truth?

523
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,038
Are you capable of it, just once?

524
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:22,079
Uncle, when did I ever lie to you?

525
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:23,829
Go ahead!

526
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:29,538
I knew you'd call with 1000 excuses

527
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:32,079
for not coming.

528
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,621
What if I got worried?

529
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:36,829
Granny taught me.

530
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:41,163
When she misses you,
she won't answer the phone.

531
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:45,246
Thinking she's sick, you go visit her!

532
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:09,871
How are you?

533
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,579
It's me, Panahi.

534
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,121
I'm really sorry to be so late.

535
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:22,954
No, I'm on my way.

536
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:31,079
Where are you right now?

537
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:40,413
Just give me a few minutes...

538
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,079
Pull over and wait.

539
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,829
I'm on my way.

540
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:51,579
He thought you called to cancel?

541
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,079
Butt out.

542
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,371
Why did you want to see me?

543
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,913
Not while you're driving.

544
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,663
Why not? We're here together.
Let's talk.

545
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,579
You're a hopeless case!

546
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:10,704
When you meet
with a smart, educated lady

547
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,413
first you take her for a frappacino,

548
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,038
ice cream
or something of the sort.

549
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:19,121
Then you talk.

550
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,579
So talk to me,

551
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:33,371
smart and educated frappacino lady.

552
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:37,788
Our film teacher

553
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:42,079
asked us to make a short movie
in a month.

554
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:46,538
I'll record you
so I remember everything.

555
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,454
You're looking for a story.

556
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,871
As Granny says,
you're sharp as a tack.

557
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,621
By the way,

558
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:58,829
when Granny came last,
we heard shouting.

559
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,079
It was the neighbors.

560
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,496
They were kicking out some people.

561
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:06,204
Turns out it was their daughter's suitor.

562
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:12,704
He threw his daughter's suitor out
during a fight?

563
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:15,163
The guy she was in love with

564
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:17,079
was Afghani.

565
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:18,663
The father didn't know.

566
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,204
When the boy came,
the father found out.

567
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:24,579
He threw him out of the house.

568
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:26,496
She was locked inside.

569
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:28,621
Still, he came back

570
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:31,621
and waited to meet her at the corner.

571
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:35,746
Her brothers beat him up several times

572
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:37,954
but he kept coming back.

573
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,121
And so?

574
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:44,413
Now, you're not being very sharp!

575
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,913
I filmed the whole thing!

576
00:42:48,663 --> 00:42:50,954
You filmed it all?

577
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:54,663
The whole thing, from A to Z!

578
00:42:56,913 --> 00:43:00,454
You made your movie.
Why look for a story?

579
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,704
You're something!

580
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,871
As a director,
you know it's un-distributable.

581
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:08,496
U n -wh at?

582
00:43:08,663 --> 00:43:10,621
Un-distributable!

583
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:14,746
All filmmakers know that and you don't?

584
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:15,788
No way!

585
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,204
You intend to show it somewhere?

586
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:22,538
Of course!

587
00:43:22,704 --> 00:43:26,329
In the Public Education Festival.

588
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:30,621
Parents are invited to the screening

589
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:33,704
and the movie they like most
gets money

590
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:37,996
to make something better
and more distributable!

591
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:40,788
Very nice!

592
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,079
Mr. Arash.

593
00:43:57,246 --> 00:44:00,038
I just made a U-turn at the overpass.

594
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:02,496
Where are you exactly?

595
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:07,579
I just passed by Divist Dastgah.

596
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:10,204
The other side?

597
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,496
At the corner.

598
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:17,121
A whitish-beige car?

599
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,788
I see you. Just a sec.

600
00:45:33,954 --> 00:45:36,121
It's been ages since you last met.

601
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,454
6 or <i>7</i> years.

602
00:45:40,663 --> 00:45:42,746
Can I tell you the truth?

603
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:45,496
He doesn't look like your kind of friend.

604
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,663
His father was
a good friend of Grandpa's.

605
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:54,288
He's from our old neighborhood.

606
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:03,246
Come on in.

607
00:46:07,038 --> 00:46:08,621
The famous Miss Hana!

608
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:10,871
How are you?

609
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:11,746
Fine thanks.

610
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,413
Your uncle has become impossible to see.

611
00:46:15,454 --> 00:46:18,246
He's forgotten his old neighbor.

612
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:20,663
He never calls

613
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,746
or answers my calls either.

614
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:26,496
You like fruit juice?

615
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,371
Orange juice? Ice cream pie?

616
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,496
No, thanks.

617
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,829
Just like her uncle, always "No thanks"!

618
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:39,121
- Frappacino?
- Love it!

619
00:46:39,288 --> 00:46:41,288
Come on, let's go.

620
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:55,246
Sorry I didn't ask you into my car.
There's someone.

621
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,371
I want this to be kept secret.

622
00:46:57,538 --> 00:47:00,454
I'll leave you a minute to look at it.

623
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:18,288
What is it?

624
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:22,121
Have a look. You'll see.

625
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:52,413
Your friend is suspicious.

626
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,246
He said to leave my camera here.

627
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,496
He may want to kidnap me!

628
00:48:23,413 --> 00:48:25,204
Want some CDs?

629
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:29,163
I have all the new stuff.

630
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:31,704
Andy, Shahriyar, Shamaeezadeh...

631
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:45,746
Local and diaspora artists.
Great stuff.

632
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:47,663
How much?

633
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:48,788
Just this one.

634
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:50,454
2 tomans.

635
00:48:51,246 --> 00:48:53,454
There are two CDs.

636
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:46,496
Did you see it?

637
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:47,746
Were you hurt?

638
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:50,079
Nothing too serious.

639
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,163
When did it happen?

640
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:55,704
Last month.

641
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,454
The security camera had just been put in.

642
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,204
Can I see it again?

643
00:50:01,746 --> 00:50:04,663
I'll show you from another angle.

644
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:10,996
This is the woman.

645
00:50:12,288 --> 00:50:14,038
This is the man.

646
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,079
He hit me with a club.

647
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,079
They're husband and wife.

648
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,079
Married?

649
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:28,329
When he threw me against the wall,

650
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:31,538
his bandana slipped to the side.

651
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:34,954
I saw his eyes. I thought I knew him.

652
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,746
That's when I felt it.

653
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:43,829
What did you do?

654
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,371
What could I do?

655
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:51,621
Did you do anything, file a complaint?

656
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:54,663
Why not?

657
00:50:55,538 --> 00:50:56,829
It was just after...

658
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:01,454
the news reports
about those criminals who got hanged.

659
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:05,829
I didn't have the heart to turn them in.

660
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:08,496
That was different.

661
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:12,746
They put the film on the news
to make a statement.

662
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:15,038
It's a different story.

663
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:17,913
It wasn't just that.

664
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,746
I recognized them.

665
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:23,038
The man and the woman.

666
00:51:23,204 --> 00:51:24,746
I know them.

667
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,371
Since then,

668
00:51:32,704 --> 00:51:34,121
I found out

669
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:36,788
they were under financial pressure.

670
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:39,246
I saw how the money they stole

671
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:42,371
helped solve their problems.

672
00:51:42,538 --> 00:51:44,871
I just couldn't have them arrested.

673
00:51:45,496 --> 00:51:46,996
I just couldn't.

674
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:49,579
When I see them, I get on edge.

675
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:52,288
It makes me choke.

676
00:51:53,163 --> 00:51:57,079
I thought talking to you
might ease the pain.

677
00:51:58,204 --> 00:52:00,746
I know you can't make movies anymore.

678
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,079
Perhaps one day

679
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,454
another director can use it.

680
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,246
Here you are.

681
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:14,621
Anything else?

682
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:27,554
It's him.

683
00:52:28,596 --> 00:52:29,346
Who?

684
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,138
The thief.

685
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,679
You should have told me.

686
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:38,096
I really wanted to see his face.

687
00:52:39,013 --> 00:52:40,221
What for?

688
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:45,304
I wanted to see
what a thief looks like.

689
00:52:47,221 --> 00:52:49,429
Like me, like you,

690
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:52,929
like anyone around us.

691
00:53:06,346 --> 00:53:08,054
How are you doing now?

692
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:10,513
Better.

693
00:53:11,846 --> 00:53:13,138
Getting better.

694
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:19,013
Still in the neighborhood?

695
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:21,138
Sure. I'm still there.

696
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:23,638
Faithful to our roots.

697
00:53:26,846 --> 00:53:28,763
I came once to visit.

698
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:33,638
I didn't recognize our street.

699
00:53:34,846 --> 00:53:37,846
Everything had changed.
Buildings razed.

700
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:40,221
The people changed too.

701
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:45,471
You rarely recognize anyone you know.

702
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:47,721
Everything's different.

703
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:58,929
Nice seeing you, Jafar.

704
00:53:59,096 --> 00:53:59,971
Same here.

705
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:01,638
Thank you for your time.

706
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:02,888
You're welcome.

707
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,263
Anything I can do?

708
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:08,054
I'm fine.

709
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,013
Just tell Hana to come back.

710
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,638
Thanks, man!

711
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:20,929
Sorry I can't help.

712
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,179
Good bye.

713
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:12,596
What nice people,
especially the orange juice guy!

714
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,846
Tell me,

715
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:19,596
what did he look like?

716
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:21,429
What do you mean?

717
00:55:21,596 --> 00:55:24,013
Normal. Like everybody else.

718
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:34,471
So you want to make
a distributable movie?

719
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:39,513
This is what I was reading
when your phone rang.

720
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:55,096
Here we go.

721
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:58,971
Teacher said a distributable movie...

722
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,263
You filming or reading?

723
00:56:01,429 --> 00:56:03,638
First, make a choice.

724
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:11,304
She said we have to respect

725
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:14,596
the following rules
to make a distributable movie.

726
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:19,429
Respect for the Islamic headscarf,

727
00:56:19,804 --> 00:56:21,888
no contact between men and women,

728
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:24,096
avoid sordid realism,

729
00:56:24,263 --> 00:56:25,888
avoid violence,

730
00:56:26,138 --> 00:56:30,138
avoid the use of a tie
for good guys.

731
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:35,054
Avoid the use of Iranian names
for good guys.

732
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:40,138
Instead use the sacred names
of the Islamic saints.

733
00:56:42,554 --> 00:56:45,471
Uncle, why won't you listen to me?

734
00:56:46,554 --> 00:56:49,679
I am. I was thinking...

735
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:51,888
About what?

736
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:55,554
I was just thinking

737
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,596
how would we manage

738
00:56:58,096 --> 00:57:00,679
with the old neighbor you just met.

739
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:04,054
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?

740
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,138
He has an Iranian name and a tie.

741
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,471
That was real life.

742
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,263
These rules apply to movies!

743
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:19,429
If we want him as a good guy in a movie,
what do we do?

744
00:57:20,596 --> 00:57:23,096
We change him from head to toe!

745
00:57:23,638 --> 00:57:25,929
You mean
make a new person from scratch?

746
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:29,013
Change his name into an Islamic one,

747
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,263
take off his tie...

748
00:57:31,513 --> 00:57:34,929
He had no beard
but we can give him a small one.

749
00:57:38,263 --> 00:57:40,054
Should I continue?

750
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:41,554
Go on.

751
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:45,429
Avoid discussing political
and economical issues...

752
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:46,554
That's enough.

753
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:50,346
My teacher said other things too.

754
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:53,304
She said we should use our judgment.

755
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:58,013
If we notice anything problematical,

756
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,054
it's up to us to censure it.

757
00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:03,429
She said: "You know better".

758
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:15,763
My dear uncle...

759
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,263
Listen.

760
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:35,804
Stay put.

761
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,221
I'll be a minute.

762
00:58:38,388 --> 00:58:39,596
Going to the bathroom?

763
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:41,138
Butt out.

764
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:42,263
Don't get out.

765
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:44,304
And don't open the door.

766
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:46,013
And don't talk to strangers.

767
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:46,763
What?

768
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,971
Just kidding! Can't you take a joke?

769
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:39,138
You, boy!

770
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,554
Hey you!

771
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:43,971
Come here!

772
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:45,596
Yeah, you!

773
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:51,679
No camera!

774
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:52,638
Come here!

775
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:56,263
No camera.

776
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,721
I saw you take that, over there.

777
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:01,596
What?

778
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:02,846
The money!

779
01:01:03,346 --> 01:01:04,929
No money in the garbage.

780
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:07,846
The money that fell
from the groom's pocket!

781
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:10,971
The groom's pocket?
I didn't see anything.

782
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:13,763
I saw it myself
and I got it on tape!

783
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:17,346
I couldn't care less.
It fell on the ground.

784
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:20,054
I found it. Now it's mine.

785
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:22,013
I saw the groom drop it.

786
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,596
My film teacher told us

787
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:27,929
we have a month to make
a distributable movie.

788
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,763
You took the money
and made it un-distributable!

789
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:34,346
Go give it back to the groom.

790
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,013
In exchange I'll give you 5 tomans.

791
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:40,096
50 for 5?

792
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,054
No one's crazy enough to do that.

793
01:01:42,304 --> 01:01:44,179
Don't worry about them.

794
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:47,846
Her makeup cost a fortune.
They can afford it.

795
01:01:48,388 --> 01:01:50,971
I don't care about their money.

796
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:53,138
I care only about my movie.

797
01:01:53,304 --> 01:01:56,929
Please, put the money back.
You're ruining my movie.

798
01:01:57,096 --> 01:02:00,304
Put it back
and you'll become my film's hero.

799
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:03,304
I want to show
sacrifice and selflessness!

800
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,388
I'm begging you, please.

801
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,846
What the fuck
is sacrifice or selflessness?

802
01:02:08,013 --> 01:02:12,679
I don't want to be a hero,
just give my dad the money.

803
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:14,596
I'm begging you, please.

804
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:17,096
Do it for your mother's sake.

805
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:18,804
I have no mother.

806
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,929
You may not have a mother,

807
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,513
but you used to love your mother.

808
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:26,596
Do it just to make your mother happy.

809
01:02:26,763 --> 01:02:29,763
Please, just go put the money back.

810
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,346
You do it.

811
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:39,138
No, you have to do it.

812
01:02:39,304 --> 01:02:42,138
You do it, I'll record it.

813
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:44,679
For God's sake, please.

814
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:46,596
Please...

815
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,346
You're so stupid!

816
01:03:21,054 --> 01:03:23,638
Hurry, they're gonna leave.

817
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,846
Give it to him!

818
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:40,638
Hurry up!

819
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:49,054
Give it back!

820
01:04:29,054 --> 01:04:30,929
Why are you so upset?

821
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:34,554
It's nothing.

822
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:05,013
Want to talk?

823
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:09,054
Don't ask. I don't want to elaborate.

824
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:13,221
Whatever you say, young lady!

825
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:33,221
Hear that too?

826
01:06:33,388 --> 01:06:34,679
Hear what?

827
01:06:35,513 --> 01:06:37,888
Do you hear that out there?

828
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:40,179
I was concentrating.

829
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:43,304
I didn't hear or see a thing.

830
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:50,929
Look, she's there!

831
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:52,429
Who?

832
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:54,638
The flower lady.

833
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:55,846
Where?

834
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,346
Don't you see?

835
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,471
The one who brings roses
when she comes to see you.

836
01:07:11,888 --> 01:07:13,596
Hello there...

837
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:17,804
Jafar Panahi, our very own!

838
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:19,513
Where are you going?

839
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:21,346
I'll call you later.

840
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:24,221
Where to? I'll take you.

841
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:25,513
Sit up front.

842
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:30,929
But you have a little passenger!

843
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:33,971
Thanks,honey.

844
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,888
How are you?

845
01:07:41,138 --> 01:07:43,763
Fine, fine, very good!

846
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:46,971
For you, sweetheart!

847
01:07:47,138 --> 01:07:49,304
Thank you very much.

848
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:53,554
How are you doing?

849
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:55,304
What's up?

850
01:07:55,596 --> 01:07:57,554
Here, of all places?

851
01:07:57,721 --> 01:07:58,429
Where to?

852
01:07:58,596 --> 01:07:59,346
Cabbie now?

853
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:01,596
Back in the driver's seat?

854
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,596
Looking for someone?

855
01:08:08,096 --> 01:08:10,888
I heard a voice
right before I saw you.

856
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:14,846
I thought
I recognized my interrogator.

857
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:18,804
Many of my clients say the same thing.

858
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,804
They want to identify people
from their voices.

859
01:08:25,388 --> 01:08:27,471
Advantage of blindfolds.

860
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:31,471
Always trying to pin down the voice.

861
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:32,554
Where to?

862
01:08:32,888 --> 01:08:34,096
Paradise!

863
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:35,304
Paradise.

864
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:38,054
There's Paradise Street...

865
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:41,721
Oh! That paradise?

866
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:43,763
That paradise.

867
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:48,721
Those gentlemen have
exclusive rights to that Paradise.

868
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:51,554
Seriously where to?

869
01:08:51,804 --> 01:08:54,221
I'm going towards Vanak.

870
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:56,221
Is it convenient?

871
01:08:56,388 --> 01:08:58,263
I don't want to be a bother.

872
01:08:58,429 --> 01:09:00,013
Let me guess.

873
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:07,138
Either you're visiting
a prisoner who just got out

874
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:09,513
or the family of someone just in.

875
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,263
I wish it were good news.

876
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:14,138
Ghonche Ghavami is now in prison.

877
01:09:15,346 --> 01:09:17,471
The girl from the stadium?

878
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,429
Just like in your movie.

879
01:09:19,596 --> 01:09:21,221
"Offside".

880
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:25,929
Ghoncheh Ghavami
attended a volleyball game.

881
01:09:27,221 --> 01:09:30,054
There were other women.

882
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:31,929
All arrested.

883
01:09:32,096 --> 01:09:36,013
Everyone was freed but her.
It's been 108 days.

884
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:38,596
Did she get to see the game?

885
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:41,888
No, they were arrested
outside the stadium.

886
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:49,013
She's been on a hunger strike
for 10 days.

887
01:09:49,179 --> 01:09:50,971
Her mother visited her.

888
01:09:51,138 --> 01:09:55,346
She tried to persuade her
to break her strike.

889
01:09:55,513 --> 01:09:57,096
We sent messages too,

890
01:09:57,263 --> 01:10:00,804
saying you're entitled
to do what you're doing.

891
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:04,263
You and I have been
on hunger strikes ourselves.

892
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:07,679
It's always our very last resort.

893
01:10:09,846 --> 01:10:11,679
She's doing the same thing.

894
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:16,013
The mother goes with food
to convince her to eat.

895
01:10:17,138 --> 01:10:20,471
They put the mother
in a room with cameras:

896
01:10:20,638 --> 01:10:22,929
"Come here, convince Ghoncheh."

897
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,179
Their typical filmed interview.

898
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,721
Obviously.

899
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:28,804
"Tell the camera

900
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:31,013
"she was never on strike."

901
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,054
The mother goes totally berserk,
storms out,

902
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:38,054
tells them to keep their visiting hours.

903
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:40,388
She takes the food and leaves.

904
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:45,179
They give Ghonche a piece of paper
and say to write the same thing:

905
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:48,596
"I never went on hunger strike".

906
01:10:48,763 --> 01:10:53,138
She refuses, rips it up
and says: "You can keep your visits!"

907
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:56,679
So that's the story.

908
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:58,554
I'm going to visit them now.

909
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:02,138
We'll see what we can do for her.

910
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:05,721
As of yesterday,
she's stopped drinking water.

911
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:09,513
We'll see what our options are.

912
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:12,179
What can we do?

913
01:11:12,346 --> 01:11:13,221
I see.

914
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,721
How is your husband?

915
01:11:16,888 --> 01:11:19,763
He's fine, busy working.

916
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:22,138
Not banned from work?

917
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:23,388
No.

918
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:27,846
I heard you got a 3-year suspension?

919
01:11:28,013 --> 01:11:29,638
No more law practice?

920
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:35,096
I heard the bar association
voted to suspend me.

921
01:11:35,929 --> 01:11:37,179
From practicing law.

922
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:40,804
I haven't received any legal notice yet.

923
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,054
For now... nothing.

924
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:45,971
It's not official until I get one.

925
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:48,388
The bar association did this?

926
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:51,096
I don't know.

927
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:54,138
Don't they defend lawyers' rights?

928
01:11:54,513 --> 01:11:59,513
As if the Directors Guild
forbade you to make movies.

929
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:02,971
How would it feel?

930
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:07,346
It's wet back here.
Someone left a purse.

931
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:08,763
A purse? Show me.

932
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:09,679
Here.

933
01:12:12,513 --> 01:12:15,346
See if there's an address or something.

934
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:18,513
That's wrong. It's not mine.

935
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:20,596
It's totally impolite.

936
01:12:20,763 --> 01:12:23,721
Sorry I asked, young lady!

937
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:28,138
This purse doesn't belong
to someone my age.

938
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:32,096
Not even for my mother's age.

939
01:12:32,263 --> 01:12:35,304
It belongs to an old lady.

940
01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:37,096
Like Granny?

941
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:38,513
Exactly!

942
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:40,554
Maybe it was...

943
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:44,179
those women who went to Ali's Spring.

944
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:46,513
My only elderly passengers.

945
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:47,596
Ali's Spring...

946
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:50,846
You must find them.
You found your way.

947
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:53,471
First I'll drop you off.

948
01:12:53,638 --> 01:12:55,721
Let me off here.

949
01:12:56,346 --> 01:12:58,263
Take the Nawab highway.

950
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:01,388
Not far.

951
01:13:01,554 --> 01:13:03,388
Totally opposite directions.

952
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:06,513
Do your thing. It's more important.

953
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:09,513
This is for the people of cinema.

954
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,304
Because the people of cinema
can be relied on.

955
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:15,763
Just like you.

956
01:13:18,054 --> 01:13:19,304
I put it there.

957
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:21,929
Don't think I don't see
what you're up to.

958
01:13:22,596 --> 01:13:24,846
You know, Jafar,

959
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:27,221
sometimes they do it on purpose

960
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:30,929
so we know they're watching us.

961
01:13:31,096 --> 01:13:33,346
Such obvious tactics.

962
01:13:33,513 --> 01:13:35,804
First they mount a political case.

963
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:39,263
You're an agent for Mossad, CIA, Ml5!

964
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,346
They beef it up
with a morality charge.

965
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:47,179
They make your life hell.

966
01:13:47,804 --> 01:13:50,596
When you finally get released,

967
01:13:50,804 --> 01:13:53,221
the outside world
becomes a bigger cell.

968
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,179
They make your best friends
your worst enemies!

969
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:02,013
Either you have to escape the country

970
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:06,388
or start hoping to go back to jail.

971
01:14:07,096 --> 01:14:10,346
In my opinion... just let it go.

972
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:12,763
That's it.

973
01:14:13,804 --> 01:14:16,763
Better to remove my words
from your movie.

974
01:14:16,929 --> 01:14:19,679
You'll be accused of sordid realism.

975
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:22,263
They'll bother you even more.

976
01:14:25,054 --> 01:14:26,888
It's green. Hurry.

977
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:29,388
Thanks, it was a pleasure.

978
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:31,971
Hurry up!

979
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,388
Get in the car.

980
01:14:48,013 --> 01:14:50,721
Uncle, isn't she lovely?

981
01:14:51,013 --> 01:14:52,513
The flower lady?

982
01:14:53,638 --> 01:14:57,888
What exactly is "sordid realism"?

983
01:14:59,346 --> 01:15:02,388
Wasn't it in your instructions?

984
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:06,179
Teacher even explained what it meant.

985
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:08,221
It didn't get it.

986
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:10,138
Bad explainer!

987
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:13,388
She said show what's real,
but not real real.

988
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:17,596
Then she said
if reality is dark and unpleasant,

989
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,888
not to show it.

990
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:23,221
Personally, I don't get the difference.

991
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:26,721
Real, unreal...
It's honestly beyond me.

992
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:28,679
Can't get it in my head.

993
01:15:29,804 --> 01:15:33,971
Like the things
flower lady just said

994
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:38,679
shouldn't be shown or spoken of.

995
01:15:39,013 --> 01:15:43,054
Nonsense.
Everything she said was real.

996
01:15:44,096 --> 01:15:47,679
There are realities
they don't want shown.

997
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:52,304
They don't want to show it
but they do it themselves.

998
01:15:52,471 --> 01:15:55,179
Whatever... I don't get it.

999
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,846
The flower is so pretty.

1000
01:17:40,513 --> 01:17:42,138
Let's see if they're here.

1001
01:18:21,638 --> 01:18:22,763
They're here.

1002
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:25,221
Where's the purse?
